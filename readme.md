# Manuscript


`Manuscript` is a simple and lightweight clone of a popular gVim editor.

Manuscript supports such core editing features, as several modes (diverged from Vim functionality), 
basic text movement, work with registers, text manipulations and some commands executed in a command line. 
App works now only on Linux, but can be easily ported to Win32.
